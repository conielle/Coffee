# ☕️ Coffee. 

## When you need it, its on demand!

When someone needs a cup of coffee, they shouldn't have to scream or shout from across the house.
With 'Coffee' you can now choose your beverage of choice, and it gets made by your in house Barista on demand.

The 'Personal Edition' is a one on one experience with a barista and a client. In an example of a use case, 
a husband would be the coffee slave better known as a barista, and his wife would be the client.

When you select your account as that of a barista you won't have order options, you can 
have multiple people order coffee in this edition, however, the selection is limited unlike 
that of the 'Family Edition' as the personal edition, is well, personal.

Long press an order that is complete and it will disappear from the list.
There is a order counter to keep track of how many coffee's were made during the day, there is also a reset button.

This app would serve no purpose if you don't get a notification that someone want's a coffee, Push Notifications
have been implemented on the creation of a Coffee request which is sent to the barista and upon completion of the order
a notification will be sent to the client that their coffee is on the way.

Serve the coffee warm, and see your client smiling.
