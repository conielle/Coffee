# ☕️ Coffee. 

## When you need it, its on demand!

When someone needs a cup of coffee, they shouldn't have to scream or shout from across the house.
With 'Coffee' you can now choose your beverage of choice, and it gets made by your in house barista on demand.

Request a coffee from a catalogue of coffee's available inhouse. A push notification will be sent to the Barista which is
assigned on the registration of the profile. This process allows for multipe "clients" to request coffee but only one device
receiving the notification of the request, in other words, the barista.

Long press an order that is complete and it will disappear from the list.
There is a order counter to keep track of how many coffee's were made during the day, there is also a reset button.

This app would serve no purpose if you don't get a notification that someone want's a coffee.
Push Notifications have been implemented on the creation of a Coffee request which is sent to the barista and upon 
completion of the ordera notification will be sent to the client that their coffee is on the way.

Serve the coffee warm, and see your client smiling.
